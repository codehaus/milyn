    	Smooks Content Filtering Framework.

		<h1>Overview</h1>
		Smooks is a framework for filtering content 
		(XML/XHTML/HTML etc) in a manner that can be optimised for a given execution context e.g. optimised for the requesting
		browser in a Servlet Container.

		<h2>XML/XHTML/HTML Filtering</h2>
		<a href="org/milyn/delivery/SmooksXML.html">SmooksXML</a> is a filtering solution for
		XML/XHTML/HTML etc.  It can be used as a Java alternative to templating solutions such as XSLT,
		or simply as an XML analysis tool (see <a href="org/milyn/report/package-summary.html">Smooks Report Generator</a>).
		SmooksXML is a DOM <a href="org/milyn/delivery/ElementVisitor.html">visitor</a> type implementation.
		<p/>
		As an alternative to XSLT, <a href="org/milyn/delivery/SmooksXML.html">SmooksXML</a> is a non-templating solution.  
		By this we mean that it doesn't "manufacture" a completely new XML document using a source document as input.  Instead,
		<a href="org/milyn/delivery/SmooksXML.html">SmooksXML</a> <a href="org/milyn/delivery/ElementVisitor.html">visits</a> the source
		document and transforms the source i.e. no new document created.
