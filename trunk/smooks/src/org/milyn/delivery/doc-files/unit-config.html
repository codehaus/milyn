		<h1>Content Delivery Units</h1>
		Smooks manipulates/transforms content for the requesting browser by applying
		Content Delivery Units.  At present there are 4 types of Content Delivery Unit
		for manipulation of HTML markup:
		<ol>
			<li><a href="../response/HtmlServletResponseWrapper.html">HtmlServletResponseWrapper</a>: This Content Delivery Unit "hooks" the 
			<a href="../SmooksHtml.html">SmooksHtml</a> class into the transformation process. <a href="../SmooksHtml.html">SmooksHtml</a>
			transforms HTML for the requesting browser by applying the following Content Delivery Units.</li>
			<li><a href="../assemble/AssemblyUnit.html">Assembly Units</a>: Applied during the <a href="../SmooksXML.html#phases">Assembly Phase</a>.</li>
			<li><a href="../trans/TransUnit.html">Transformation Units</a>: Applied during the <a href="../SmooksXML.html#phases">Transformation Phase</a>.</li>
			<li><a href="../serialize/SerializationUnit.html">Serialization Units</a>: Applied during the <a href="../SmooksXML.html#phases">Serialisation Phase</a>.</li>
		</ol>
		In a Servlet Container, other forms of content (e.g. images, .css etc) can be transformed for the requesting browser
		by applying other implementations of the 
		<a href="../response/ServletResponseWrapper.html">ServletResponseWrapper</a> abstract class.
		<p/>
		Content Delivery Units are what Smooks is all about!  Smooks is extended by developing and deploying 
		Content Delivery Units.  

		<p/>
		Content Delivery Units are targeted at specific elements of content through a special
		configuration file called a "Content Delivery Resource List File" (.cdrl).  The DTD for this file can be seen
		at <a href="/dtd/cdres-list-1.0.dtd" type="text/plain">http://www.milyn.org/dtd/cdres-list-1.0.dtd</a>

		<h2 id="cdrs">Content Delivery Resources</h2>
		You will also encounter the term "Content Delivery Resource".  What is the difference between
		"Content Delivery Resource" and "Content Delivery Unit?"
		<ul>
			<li><b>Content Delivery Resource</b>:  Any resource used by Smooks to deliver
				content to the requesting browser.  These resources are targeted at browsers
				using the .cdrl files (as above).
			</li>
			<li><b>Content Delivery Unit</b>:  An <u>executable</u> Content Delivery Resource.  See
				<a href="../ContentDeliveryUnit.html">ContentDeliveryUnit</a> and it's sub-interfaces
				(<a href="../assemble/AssemblyUnit.html">AssemblyUnit</a> etc).
			</li>
		</ul>
		Examples of non-executable Content Delivery Resource would be "dtd" and "doctype" resources.  See
		<a href="dtds.cdrl">dtds.cdrl</a> and <a href="doctype.cdrl">doctype.cdrl</a> from the 
		<a href="http://milyn.codehaus.org/downloads/">CNN.com sample</a>.  Non-executable Content Delivery Resources
		can be loaded (e.g. by a Content Delivery Unit) through calls to 
		<a href="../ContentDeliveryConfig.html#getCDRDefs(java.lang.String)">ContentDeliveryConfig.html.getCDRDefs()</a>.
		
		<h2>Archive Definition File Structure</h2>
		See the <a href="../../cdr/CDRDef.html">CDRDef</a> class Javadoc.
		
		<h2 id="cdu-selection">Content Delivery Unit Selection</h2>
		See the <a href="../../cdr/CDRDef.html">CDRDef</a> class Javadoc.

		<h2 id="cdrar">.cdrar Files</h2>
		.cdrar files are a Jar format file used to bundle Content Delivery Units/Resources and .cdrl files (optional).
		While Content Delivery Resources can be loaded in the standard way from the classpath, it is thought that 
		this may be a cleaner way to deliver resources in a production environment.
		<p/>
		The following illustration shows the internal structure of a sample .cdrar file.

		<h2>Sample Configurations</h2>
		The following are sample .cdrl files from the <a href="http://milyn.codehaus.org/downloads/">CNN.com sample</a>.
		<h3>Sample 1 - serialise-basic.cdrl</h3>
		This .cdrl file targets some <a href="../serialize/SerializationUnit.html">Serialization Units</a>.
		<p/>
		<img src="serialisationunits.gif" border="1" />
		<p/>
		From this image you can see there are 3 <a href="../../cdr/CDRDef.html">CDRDef.html">CDRDefs</a> defined in this archive.
		It might occur to you that all 3 definitions are applicable to EMPTY elements on "wml" profile browsers.
		To see how the correct Serialisation Unit is selected, see the section on 
		<a href="#cdu-selection">Content Delivery Unit Selection</a>.
		<h3>Sample 2 - assembly.cdrl</h3>
		It targets a number of <a href="../assemble/AssemblyUnit.html">Assembly Units</a> at some custom sample tags created to pull/scrape 
		content from the CNN.com homepage source.
