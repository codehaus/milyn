<h1>Explorer 6 Duplicate Characters Bug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>

<ul>

<p style="margin: 0 20% 20px 22%;"><strong>
This demo originally appeared in an article for 
<a href="http://www.communitymx.com/abstract.cfm?cid=AAE6A9685DE8A586">Communitymx.com</a></strong>
</p>

<p>
Internet Explorer 6 has a puzzling bug involving multiple floated elements; text characters 
from the last of the floated elements are sometimes duplicated below the last float. This bug 
is a real headbanger because there seems to be nothing triggering it. However, by now everyone 
should <em>know</em> that IE needs no excuse to misbehave.
</p>

<p>
The direct cause is nothing more than ordinary <strong>HTML&nbsp;comments</strong>, such as, 
<span class="inlineimp" 
style="white-space: nowrap;">&lt;!--&nbsp;end&nbsp;left&nbsp;column&nbsp;--></span>, 
sandwiched between floats that come in sequence. Apparently, the comments are hard for IE to 
digest when they occupy those positions, resulting in a kind of "screen diarrhea".  HTML 
comments inside the floats do not cause the bug, nor do comments before or after the float 
series. Only comments residing between floats cause the bug. 
</p>

<p>
The effect seen is that some of the last characters from the last floated element of the series 
are repeated outside and below that floated element. The first sandwiched comment does nothing 
unusual, but two comments cause the last two characters in that last float to repeat. Each 
additional comment makes two more characters join the party. It doesn't matter which pair of 
floats straddle the comments. In fact the two <strong>triggering comments</strong> may follow 
different floats as long as they have floats both before and after them.

</p>

Second float<br /><br />

<span style="background: #f2ab82;">
In IE6 some of this text is replicated in a "mystery block element" that starts directly below 
the float. This light brown float has a 2px bottom margin which also duplicates into the mystery 
element, getting added to the bottom of the text if it is wrapped in a span as it has been 
here.

<div class="textbox">

<p>
<strong>This live demo's construction</strong> starts with a 250px wide container 
(green border), holding first a 200px wide float (gray), and a second (light brown) float, which is 
given a width of 250px, the same as the container's width. Inside that second float is a red bordered 
paragraph containing spanned text, and an image just for fun. The span is not required for the bug to 
occur, but is used here to help illustrate the bug. Finally there is a simple "cleared" block element (green). 
Additionally, there is a 2px bottom margin on the lower float to push the duplicated text down and make 
the demo slightly less confusing. 

</p>

<div>
<img style="float: right; margin: 30px 15% 10px 25px; display: inline; width: 256px; height: 280px;" 
src="images/commentbug-shot2.gif" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
If you look at the source of this page, you will see 50 ordinary HTML comments in between the 
two floats. The first one is "free," but each of the remaining comments will trigger the replication 
of two characters from the last float into the area just below it. The bug considers the image to be 
worth two characters when duplication is occuring. The length of the text in the comment does not 
matter. We know that no one is likely to be putting 50 comments in between floats, but in this case, 
they sure make the demo more dramatic!
</p>

<p style="clear: both;">
Below is a simplified version of the code used to make this live demo:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;div class="demobox" >

&lt;div class="firstfloat">First float&lt;/div>

&lt;!-- comment --> &lt;!-- comment --> &lt;!-- comment --> 
&lt;!-- comment --> &lt;!-- comment --> &lt;!-- comment -->
  etc, etc, etc... (50 in all)

&lt;div class="secondfloat">
&lt;p>
Second float

&lt;span>

In IE6 some of this text is replicated in a 
"mystery block element" that starts directly 
below the float. This tan colored float has a 
2px bottom margin which also duplicates into 
the mystery element, getting added to the 
bottom of the text if it is wrapped in a span, 
as it has been here.

&lt;a href="#">Test&nbsp;link&lt;/a>
&lt;img src="images/pinecone3.jpg" alt="" />

&lt;/span>
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div> &lt;!-- End of second float -->

&lt;div style="clear: both;">Cleared element&lt;/div>

&lt;/div> &lt;!-- End of .demobox -->
</pre>

<p>
<strong style="color: #036;">Important:</strong> These extra comments trigger the bug <em>only</em> 
when the final float fills the container to  the right edge, or to within less than 3px away from it. 
This is because IE6/win seems to have a weird 3px "bumper" margin on the right side of that last left 
float. Since the float in this demo is exactly as wide as the container, the bumper has no empty space 
to occupy, and apparently it is this that completes the bug trigger. The effect also shows 
<strong>symmetry</strong>, working the same way in a mirror version of this coding.
</p>

<p>
Note that if the floats were horizontally next to each other and their widths when added together  
equaled the container width, the bug would still be triggered. Also remember that when many floats are 
involved, it doesn't matter which floats the comments fall between, as  long as they are between any 
floats in the set. The comment bug triggers accumulate!
</p>

<p>
<strong><span style="color: #c00">Update!</span> July 5, 2004</strong> 
&#8212 It turns out that this duplicating characters bug can be triggered
by other things than just HTML comments. 
<a href="http://www.wubbleyew.com/blog/"><strong>Phil&nbsp;Baines</strong></a> points out that <em>any</em>

elements given the style {display:&nbsp;none} will also induce the bug. In fact, 
even hidden inputs can do it, and presumably any other elements that don't actually
display for some reason. Apparently the act of hiding a source element is the 
critical trigger for this bug.
</p>

<p>
Nice catch, Phil!
</p>

<div>
<img style="float: right; margin: 30px 15% 10px 25px; display: inline; width: 256px; height: 426px;" 
src="images/commentbug-shot.gif" alt="" />
</div>

<h4>Even More Weirdness</h4>

<p>
Notice what happens when the duplicated link is hovered, causing a background change. 
Both the real link and its clone show the hover effect, and hovering makes some of the 
duplicate text show the padding from the donor float's paragraph! Most kinds of hover 
changes on the link will do this, but not all. Every IE bug that involves hover changes 
seem to be triggered by the same style alterations. Changing the font doesn't do it,
but applying a background on hover does. 

</p>

<p>
Check out what happens to the image! Oh dear. Say, what about the red border showing up around the 
duplicate text? Is the paragraph itself being cloned as well? Are you getting dizzy yet?
</p>

<p>
Another thing to notice is the text in the green clearing element. The text actually says 
"Cleared element", but it is partly lost on the left side! The length of missing text is 
exactly the same as the width of the left padding on the donor float paragraph. Arrrgh! You 
may not want to hear this, but upon hovering either link, the bottom margin on the float is 
replicated below the cleared element...
</p>

<p>
Okay, we'll stop now.
</p>

<h4>Fixes and Workarounds</h4>

<p>
One easy fix is to put a -3px right margin on the last left float. The 
opposite can be done for layouts with right floats. This seems to be a harmless fix that works 
every time. Another fix is to give the container element 3px of extra width, so that it is 3px 
larger than the last float. Sometimes a dimension on the cleared element will stop the text 
duplication, but not the "Reverse padding bug" in the cleared element. 
</p>

<p>
Or, you could just remove the bug triggering comments, but that would be cheating, wouldn't it?
</p>

<h4>Special Info</h4>
<p style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px; background: #def;">
The murky veil surrounding the need for a box dimension to prevent so many IE bugs has been partially
lifted, due to the discovery of a heretofore
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/properties/haslayout.asp">obscure&nbsp;page</a> 
in the massive Microsoft website. There is no real explaination of this "hasLayout" property, but now there is at least some
structure to the madness that has been inflicted on us by Microsoft, for what it's worth. Apparently a box needs "Layout" or all 
heck can break loose, bug-wise. MS does not state that specifically, but their browser behaviors leave no doubt whatsoever.
</p>



<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>
This problem can appear in different ways, but it always involves text duplicated out of the 
last float in a float series, and two or more HTML comments between the float elements. The 
effects can get even weirder but there's no need to become obsessed, so we'll quietly close the 
door on this crazy bug.
