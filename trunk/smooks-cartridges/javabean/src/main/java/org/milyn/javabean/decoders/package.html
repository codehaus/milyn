        Pre-installed data type decoders.

		<h2>Package Specification</h2>
        All the decoders defined in this package should follow the naming convention "<i>type</i>Decoder", where
        "type" is the type property value used on the bean binding configuration.  This allows the decoder for
        "type" to be loaded automatically. See the sample in <a href="../AbstractBeanPopulator.html">AbstractBeanPopulator</a>.
