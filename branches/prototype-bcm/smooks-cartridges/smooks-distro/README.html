        <h3>What is Smooks?</h3>
        <a href="http://milyn.codehaus.org/Smooks">Smooks</a>
        is a Java Framework for performing Fragment based Data
        Transformation and Analysis using existing data processing technologies
        (such as XSLT, Java, FreeMarker, Groovy script and more).
        <p/>
        Smooks allows you to mix and match different technologies within the
        context of a single message transform, but does so in a way that provides
        a degree of isolation between the different technologies. This helps to
        maintain the portability of your transformation/analysis logic.
