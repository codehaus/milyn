    <!-- TODO:
            THIS IS A CONFIGURATION TEMPLATE!!  It is not the finished article.

            1. For each <resource-config>, set the selector to the event element against which the bean instance should
               be created i.e. on which the beans lifecycle should be associated.
            2. Update the selector on each <binding> to select the event element/attribute supplying the binding data
               for that bean property.
            3. Check the type attribute on the bindings.  Not all will be set; depending on the actual property type.
               These must be configured by hand e.g. you may need to configure a custom decoder for the field (e.g. for
               date fields).
            4. Double check that <binding> config template elements have been added for all relevant properties.  Check
               this against the actual code.

            Determining the selector values can sometimes be difficult, especially for non XML Sources (Java etc).
            The Html Reporting tool can be a great help here because it helps you visualise the input message model
            (against which the selectors will be applied) as seen by Smooks.  So, first off, generate a report using
            your Source data, but with an empty transformation configuration.  In the report, you can see the model
            against which you need to add your configurations.  Add the configurations one at a time, rerunning the
            report to check they are being applied.

            For details on how to run a report, see the Smooks User Guide (http://milyn.codehaus.org/Smooks+User+Guide#SmooksUserGuide-CheckingtheSmooksExecutionProcess).
