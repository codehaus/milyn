		<h2 id="cdrar">.cdrar Files</h2>
		.cdrar files are a Jar format file used to bundle Content Delivery Units/Resources and .cdrl files (optional).
		While Content Delivery Resources can be loaded in the standard way from the classpath, it is thought that 
		this may be a cleaner way to deliver resources in a production environment.
		<p/>
		The following illustration shows the internal structure of a sample .cdrar file.

		<h2>Sample Configurations</h2>
		The following are sample .cdrl files from the <a href="http://milyn.codehaus.org/downloads/">CNN.com sample</a>.
		<h3>Sample 1 - serialise-basic.cdrl</h3>
		This .cdrl file targets some <a href="../serialize/SerializationUnit.html">Serialization Units</a>.

		From this image you can see there are 3 <a href="../../cdr/CDRDef.html">CDRDef.html">CDRDefs</a> defined in this archive.
		It might occur to you that all 3 definitions are applicable to EMPTY elements on "wml" profile browsers.
		To see how the correct Serialisation Unit is selected, see the section on 
		<a href="#cdu-selection">Content Delivery Unit Selection</a>.
		<h3>Sample 2 - assembly.cdrl</h3>
		It targets a number of <a href="../assemble/AssemblyUnit.html">Assembly Units</a> at some custom sample tags created to pull/scrape 
		content from the CNN.com homepage source.
