		<h1>HTML Content Delivery Phases</h1>
		Smooks HTML content delivery is a 3 phase process:
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b><u>Assembly</u></b>: The assembly phase is the process of <u>assembling the content
				to be manipulated/transformed</u> i.e. getting it into a Document Object Model (DOM). 
				This means parsing the input document and iterating over 
				it to apply all <a href="../assemble/AssemblyUnit.html">AssemblyUnit</a>s.  This phase 
				can result in DOM elements getting added to, or trimmed from, the DOM.  This phase is also
				very usefull for gathering information about the DOM, which can be used during the 
				transformation phase (see below).
			</li>
			<li>
				<b><u>Transformation</u></b>: The transformation phase takes the assembled DOM and 
				iterates over it to apply all <a href="../trans/TransUnit.html">TransUnit</a>s.
				This phase will only operate on DOM elements that were present in the assembled
				document; <a href="../trans/TransUnit.html">TransUnit</a>s will not be applied
				to elements that are introduced to the DOM during this phase.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b><u>Serialisation</u></b>: The serialisation phase takes the transformed DOM and 
				iterates over it to apply all <a href="../serialize/SerializationUnit.html">SerializationUnit</a>s
				which write the document to the target device output stream.
			</li>
		</ol>
		This whole process sounds like a lot of processing.  Well, it is.  Three iterations
		over the DOM.  However, the thinking on this is that:
		<ul>
			<li>
				The assembly phase is bypassed if there no <a href="../assemble/AssemblyUnit.html">AssemblyUnit</a>s
				configured for the requesting device.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../assemble/AssemblyUnit.html">AssemblyUnit</a>s are stateless which means
				that multiple instances don't need to be instanciated.
			</li>
			<li>
				The transformation phase is likely to be the most processing intensive of the three 
				phases but the DOM to be transformed should have been reduced as much as possible by the
				assembly phase.  Remember, assembly doesn't just mean "adding" to the DOM.
			</li>
			<li>
				The transformation phase is only applied to elements that were in the DOM 
				at the start of that phase.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../trans/TransUnit.html">TransUnit</a>s are normally stateless (<a href="../trans/TransUnitPrototype.html">TransUnitPrototype</a>) 
				which means that multiple instances shouldn't need to be instanciated.
			</li>
			<li>
				A single instance of the <a href="../serialize/DefaultSerializationUnit.html">DefaultSerializationUnit</a>
				performs the vast majority of the work in the serialisation phase.  Only elements that require
				special attention require a specialised <a href="../serialize/SerializationUnit.html">SerializationUnit</a>.
			</li>
		</ul>
