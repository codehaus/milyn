    	Smooks Browser-Aware Content Delivery Adapter.

		<h1>Overview</h1>
		The Smooks "Browser-Aware Content Delivery Adapter" is an attempt to to develop
		a framework for delivering optimised content driven by a requesting browsers:
		
		<ol>
			<li>name,</li>
			<li>profile-set, and</li>
			<li>markup definition (DTD)</li>
		</ol>
		
		This way we can develop descreet pieces of transformation logic (we call these 
		"Content Delivery Units") to perform specific types of transforming operations on 
		content before delivery to the browser e.g. the content contains XForms markup 
		but the requesting browser doesn't support XForms.
		<p/>
		Check out the Smooks User Docs online at <a href="http://milyn.codehaus.org/Smooks" target="new">milyn.codehaus.org</a>.

		Content Delivery is performed by the classes in the <a href="org/milyn/package-summary.html">org.milyn</a> 
		package.
